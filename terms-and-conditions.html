                                                    hearings, if any, by teleconference or videoconference, rather than by personal

                                                    at a location which is reasonably convenient to both parties with due
                                                    consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances, and (C) if
                                                    the parties are unable to agree on a location, such determination should be made
                                                    by the AAA or by the arbitrator.

                                                    If you or WellzOn submits a dispute to arbitration and the arbitrator orders
                                                    any exchange of information, you and WellzOn agree to cooperate to seek from

                                                    might be exchanged or the subject of discovery in the arbitration. You and
                                                    WellzOn agree to seek such protection before any such information, documents,
                                                    testimony, or materials are exchanged or otherwise become the subject of
                                                    discovery in the arbitration. The arbitrator has exclusive authority to make all
                                                    procedural and substantive decisions regarding any dispute and to grant any
                                                    remedy that would otherwise be available in court, including the power to
                                                    determine the question of arbitrability.

                                                    The arbitrator’s decision will follow these Terms and will be final and binding.
                                                    The arbitrator will have authority to award temporary, interim, or permanent
                                                    injunctive relief or relief providing for specific performance of these Terms, but
                                                    only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the individual Dispute
                                                    before the arbitrator. The award rendered by the arbitrator may be confirmed and
                                                    enforced in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Notwithstanding any of the
                                                    foregoing, nothing in these Terms will preclude you from bringing issues to the

                                                    relief against us for you.
